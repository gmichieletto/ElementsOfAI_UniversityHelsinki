# Write a program that generates 10000 random zeros and ones where the probability of one is p1 and the probability of zero is 1-p1
# (hint: np.random.choice([0,1], p=[1-p1, p1], size=10000)), counts the number of occurrences of 5 consecutive ones ("11111") in the sequence,
# and outputs this number as a return value. Check that for p1 = 2/3, the count is close to 10000 x (2/3)^5 â‰ˆ 1316.9.
